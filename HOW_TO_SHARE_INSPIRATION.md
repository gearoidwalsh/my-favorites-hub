# 🎬 How to Share Video Inspiration

## Ways to Share What You're Looking For:

### **Option 1: Describe the Effect** (Easiest)
Just tell me what you see! For example:
- "The background has gradients that shift from left to right"
- "Colors change as you scroll down"
- "There are floating shapes that pulse"
- "The background has a wave-like motion"
- "It looks like liquid or water moving"

### **Option 2: Share Screenshots or GIFs**
- Take screenshots of key moments
- Create a GIF of the effect
- Paste images directly into the chat
- I can see and analyze images!

### **Option 3: Describe Specific Elements**
Tell me about:
- **Motion:** "The gradient moves horizontally" or "Shapes pulse in and out"
- **Colors:** "It goes from purple to pink to blue"
- **Speed:** "It moves slowly" or "It's fast and energetic"
- **Timing:** "It changes when I scroll" or "It's always moving"
- **Style:** "It's subtle" or "It's very bold and vibrant"

### **Option 4: Reference Similar Effects**
Say things like:
- "Like the background in [website/app name]"
- "Similar to Instagram Stories gradient backgrounds"
- "Like those TikTok transitions where colors shift"
- "Like Apple's website with the moving gradients"

### **Option 5: Use Video Links**
If you have YouTube, Vimeo, or other links:
- Share the URL
- Tell me the timestamp (e.g., "at 0:15-0:30")
- Describe what happens in that section

## 🎯 What I Need to Know:

When describing, include:
1. **What moves?** (gradients, shapes, colors, patterns)
2. **How does it move?** (horizontal, vertical, pulsing, morphing)
3. **When does it move?** (always, on scroll, on hover)
4. **What colors?** (or "I'll tell you later")
5. **How intense?** (subtle background or bold feature)

## 💡 Example Description:

**Good description:**
> "I want a background like this TikTok edit I saw where there are 3-4 gradient layers that slowly shift horizontally. The colors blend together and it looks like they're flowing. It's subtle enough that you can still read text over it. The gradients move at different speeds so they create this wave-like effect."

**I can work with that!** I'll implement:
- Multiple gradient layers
- Horizontal animation
- Different speeds for each layer
- Subtle opacity
- Smooth blending
